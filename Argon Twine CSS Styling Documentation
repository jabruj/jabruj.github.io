title: 'Part 4: CSS Styling in Twine'
---

Note: For this tutorial, refer to [Basic 3D Objects](https://github.com/adachille/Argon-for-Twine-Documentation/blob/master/DocumentationExamples/example1/basic-3D-objects-example.html)

You can add CSS styling to your Argon project. First, you need to make sure you are implementing Normalize.css. This ensures that your browser renders all elements more consistently. You should initialize this before proceeding. Here’s an example:

‘’’html

<script src="https://use.fontawesome.com/46b4065509.js"></script>
<style id="style-normalize" type="text/css">/*! normalize.css v3.0.3 | MIT License | github.com/necolas/normalize.css */

‘’’


We need to set the default font family to sans-serif. Safari and Internet Explorer will try to change the font size as the user changes his/her device orientation. 


‘’’html

html {
  font-family: sans-serif;  
-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;
  -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;
}

‘’’

Remove the default margin.

‘’’html

body {
  margin: 0;
}

‘’’

When adding the initial html elements, define the summary block to be zero. Without this, Internet Explorer 11 does not correctly define the display for ‘main.’ 

‘’’css

article,
aside,
details,
figcaption,
figure,
footer,
header,
hgroup,
main,
menu,
nav,
section,
summary {
  display: block;
}
‘’’

We first correct the ‘inline-block’ display for Internet Explorer 8 and 9. We also need to normalize the vertical alignment of ‘progress’ in Firefox, Chrome, and Opera.  

‘’’html

progress,
video {
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: baseline;
}

‘’’

We don’t want our browser to sound without our input. We add this bit of code:

‘’’html

audio:not([controls]) {
  display: none;
  height: 0;
}

‘’’

Now we need to address the ‘[hidden]’ styling not present in Internet Explorer 8,9, and 10, and hide the ‘template’ element. 

‘’’html

[hidden],
template {
  display: none;
}

‘’’’

Remove the gray background color from active links. To improve readability of elements when they are in an active/hover state, add this line:

‘’’html

a {
  background-color: transparent;
}

a:active,
a:hover {
  outline: 0;
}

‘’’

We’ve made lots of progress. Now we need to address the text.
